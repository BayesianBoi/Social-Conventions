# Social-Conventions Tipping Point Simulation
This repository contains a NetLogo script designed to simulate the spread of new social conventions within different network structures. The simulation explores the effects of a committed minority on altering prevailing social norms, examining the roles of both minority size and the node degree of influential agents. Parameters derived from Centola et al, 2018 empirical study on social tipping points.

## Key features:

- Implementation of Independent Cascade (IC) model with a memory (M) component.
- Dynamic assignment of agents with varying degrees of connectivity within the network.
- Variation of committed minority sizes (10%, 20%, 30%) to identify the social tipping point.
- Comparison between random versus high-degree node placement of committed minority agents.


Results from the model provide insights into how network structure and the strategic positioning of committed individuals can impact the speed and extent of social convention adoption. The findings align with Critical Mass Theory and extend its application by emphasizing the importance of network topology and node influence.
